# OIBSIP-Task-2-Tribute-Page
A Tribute page is basically an overview of someone whom we admire in our life. In this project, I am creating a tribute page of late A.P.J Abdul kalam sir using HTML and CSS. We create a box to the page. Inside the box we add an image to the left side of the page. We will write a biography and few achievements and some details.
We will use div tag and p tag to write the details and img tag for image. Then using the CSS, we will align and beautify the design like the content color, width, height, font-size, padding, margin, etc.
